# Overview

C++ standards are named for the year they became official.
The first big C++ standard was C++98, which gave the world templates, the Standard C++ Library, and other things.
C++03 fixed some problems with C++98.

*C++11* was the first of a new 3 year standardization schedule approach.
It brought in a lot of new features and changed the basic recommended style of C++ programming in many ways.

*C++14* added many extensions to things that were added in C++11.

*C++17* extended C++14 and added a number of new features

*C++20* is now in progress, but many new features are likely.

·         Bjarne Stroustrup has a FAQ with an extensive list of C++11 features with short descriptions of each. Not completely up to date, but a good quick reference.
·         Herb Sutter has a short intro to some of the more important features, and lots of other good info on his site. Again, not completely up to date.
·         Scott Meyers's latest book "Effective Modern C++" is available in Safari.
·         This gcc page explains which features of which standard are implemented in which version of the GCC compiler.
·         There are a thousand really good videos from C++ conferences available online. For example, here.  StackOverflow and reddit are valuable resources.
